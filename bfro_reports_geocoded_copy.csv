The hair/fur was a rather rusty brown and wavy or matted. It didn’t look like a recently cleaned coat if you were to compare it to cleaning your dogs coat etc. It looked like it was unkept and even sort of dread-locked appearance hair. I do recall that some of the hair on the body was rather long about 10 inches and I could see it move as the creature walked away. It looked a lot like of the reggae/rhasta type hair styles but not completely covering the body but just various strands of it throughout (maybe shedding from winter??).  The creature had a rather glum face or expression, like a lonely old man who didn’t have any friends. I do recall its eyes sort of reminding my like that of an orangutang and sunken in.  It by far didn’t look evil, or mad in any way even though we were terrified. I think we may have woken it up and it was surprised and maybe a little irritated that it had to leave its comfortable seat next to the creek.  The hair around its head sort of drooped down on the sides. There didn’t seem to be much hair on its face but it did have some. The nose may have been flat. I don’t recall any details about the mouth or ears etc. Its possible it had a slight cone shape to its head but not drastic.  I don’t recall any smells or odors associated with it.  There really wasn’t a neck and when it moved its legs just seemed to float forward without any obvious effort. The animal appeared confident, agile and very graceful.  Once it disappeared into where-ever, I don’t have clear details into the rest of the moment.  I know we walked over to the site and I felt the tree where it was sitting and recall it was warm to the touch.  I think we looked around for tracks and there may have been some but it was so mucky and swampy it wasn’t clear, but I’m fairly certain we could at least see that the ground and brush was a little disturbed etc.  There was not a lot of vegetation between me and the creature as far as having part of my vision blocked. I could see the entire creature for the most part except for minor sticks and things in the way as it moved.  We more than likely hung out at the spot for sometime recalling what we saw as young kids do. I think back now though, that I don’t recall each of us sharing exactly what the other one saw because I think we each thought that we saw the same thing.  As far as arm size or length I don’t recall a big size comparison but I think they were a little longer than a humans. It seemed to walk with its arms to its side with maybe the forearms slightly facing out/forward like a jogger but its arms didn’t swing at all to my recall. I was totally aware of such a creature as Bigfoot back then, even through I don’t recall us saying it was “bigfoot”. I think I believed in this creature the moment I had seen the Patterson film in the early 70's maybe a few years before my sighting.  It just seemed real even through what I saw didn’t resemble that one very much. Its possible what I saw was rather old. It just had the sense that it was wise and old.  I don’t feel that my prior belief or viewing of the Patterson film caused in anyway to make up what I saw in any way or influence/convince me in seeing what I saw, since they were slightly different in appearance etc. There were other reports in and around N. Michigan the entire time I grew up there. In fact a year or two after my sighting there had been accounts in the local newspaper (Crawford Co. Avalanche) of strange sighting and incidents by members of the National Guard. I heard that about 40 people watched a creature on the artillery range with binoculars for awhile and that something was jumping on a tank and banging on the outside while there were soldiers inside.  They did not see what it was because it was nighttime but the story’s I remember is that it was being called the “tank-banger”.  There have been many numerous sighting in and around the Grayling area through the 70's. I had briefly mentioned my story to the other friend who was with me about a year ago just to see if he remembered it.  I think he was surprised that I did too and seemed to not have as vivid of a recall as I feel I have.  In fact he was unsure of what he saw and sort of felt it was a human. Anything is possible and I respect what he claims to have seen, but I have no doubt that what I saw was how I described it above.  I never felt at the time it was a human or a bear, it felt like something unknown to my mind and creepy. Since we never talked about details after our sighting, I just assumed they saw exactly what I saw and they felt the same about me, unfortunately we didn’t compare our stories the moment it happened. I don’t recall who my third friend was but I’m certain there was one other with us. Some of the minor details have faded since this is about 35 years ago but the appearance of the animal has always been clear to me.","You can reach the location by traveling N. from Main Street In Grayling, going past the hospitol and elementary school and proceeding north down Roberts Road.

We rode our bikes to one of the wooded fortifications next to a stream.  That was our base where we parked our bikes.  We would form teams and on this day throw pebbles for a kill when you found someone. So one team would wait three minutes while the other team hid.  During one of our breaks I was busting some softball sized rocks against each other in the stream to see the crystals inside.  After we were done, near sunset, we started riding back to the base housing and I remembered the rocks and decided I wanted to go back and get some of the chips.  So two of my friends and I doubled back and coasted downhill and then up the embankment.  We stopped at the top and upon looking down at the stream saw what looked like a black bear in the stream where I had left the rocks.  When it stood up on two legs, turned around and looked at us we all started screaming because it was not at bear at all.  Though we were 40 feet apart we did not see a face, but the smell was like road kill.  It then ran on two feet without making any sound that I could hear north along the stream faster than we could have rode our bikes.  We rode back toward the base and gathered older kids playing basketball and went back searching armed with sticks, rocks, and mop poles.  No tracks or other signs beyond a few more turned over rocks in the stream were found.  We decided it was either a Bigfoot or some advanced all over hair ghillie battle suit with six million dollar man powered legs.","If you are going toward Hopewell from Petersburg on 36 there is a circular ""subdivision"" across from the gates on the left.  At the time, the basketball courts are on the northwest side and the trail into the woods runs northeast kind of parallel to 36.

One of our duties was to guard the CAC building at the fort. This is the most important building on base. It is what we called the Comand Staff War School. It was guarded 24/7 everyone in had to sign in and out. NO EXCEPTIONS this was a very serious detail. Personally I hated it. I found myself on duty at the CAC with another MP we called JJ he told me about how an MP Officer had seen some big hairy thing along the river banks just a few days earlier, The officer was scared spitless according to JJ's story. He went on to say that this thing had been seen several times over the last few years and it's got everybody pretty spooked. The Officer in Question made a formal report about his experiance. His career was over shortly after that, The military keeps records on everthing including this one. The river runs along the entire east side of this installation and it is really thick flooded timber and lowlands. You could hide a herd of elephants in there for years and no one would ever know. I never saw this thing but we did see foot prints one evening down along the river. I was impressed with the size of these things, They were 14-16 long but it was the width that was really shocking, 6-7in. wide. It was almost like a snow shoe at the ball of the foot, It was in fresh snow and back in the heavy stuff where no one would have gone to play games. We were sent there to search for a runaway dependent. (Some Officers daughter that had gone to Kansas City with her boy friend as it turned out.) Like I said these prints were big.

0101000020E61000007B832F4CA65253C063EE5A423E584140,71.3,"I experienced this incident while living on a military base in North Carolina.  I was approximately 14 or 15 years old at the time, I am fifty now, however the incident is still fresh in my mind.  At that time there was nothing for a young boy to do so my favorite pastime was wandering the military reservation and search for discarded C rations as we never had enough to eat in the house.There was 8 people in my family.  One day I had skipped school to go C ration hunting.  I never will forget that day, it was very warm and sunny, which for North Carolina is not unusual for a fall day.  We used to call it indian summer.  I had been wandering the deeper recesses of the reservation and was quite proud of the fact that not only had I stumbled across old farmsteads that the Marine corps had condemed in order to take the land but had a pretty good supply of discarded C rations.  Realizing it was getting late and I had better get home, I hit a tank trail made by the marines for thier vehicles to use.  I was getting closer to home so I decided to leave the trail and short cut it through the woods.  I knew this particular area and always avoided it because it was known as a pocosin, which in local terms meant an area that is real dense and swampy.  As I made my way in to the pocosin something really seemed out of the ordinary, all day I was used to hearing the sounds of the forest, birds, frogs squirrels chattering and what was great not seeing another human being. Now it was so quiet it didn't seem natural.  Something made me stop and to this very day I am perplexed about this I don't know why because at that age you have no fear as you think you are going to live forever.  I had no fear this time either however I felt that I was being watched.  I have never had this feeling again.  I slowly started to turn my head to the right when I caught a glimpse of brown.  My first thought was oh its only a deer.  I stood stock still and kept looking at the brown patch and it didnt move.  It was in a VERY dense part of the pocosin and my second thought was maybe its not a deer but possibly a discarded marine corps field jacket.  Now that would be a treasure, as I started to go towards the object I seem to hear the crashing of brush first then that brown patch moved, only it moved higher.  I  estimate a height of between 8 and 10 feet.  As it grew in height it also grew broader exposing more of itself.  I never saw its head or any real features other than the long fur because that thing was moving so fast through that pocosin that I was amazed how any animal that size could do that.  The crashing of the branches and underbrush was loud and I all I could do was stand there.  I don't know how long I remained in that position, all I rememeber is the sounds of the forest returned and thats what snapped me back to the present.  I have only recalled this story once and was told never again to repeat it to anyone or go back in those woods.  I have never returned to that area.","On the military reservation Camp Lejuene marine corps base approximately 5 miles from Highway 24 in Hubert, North Carolina.",Onslow County,North Carolina,Report 1939: Youth's presence startles unknown animal,34.6894,-77.2914,1965-10-01,1939,Class A,dq1j35n07u,79.34,75.32,243,68.96,0.79,0.89,0.22,0,0,,1016.43,Humid and mostly cloudy throughout the day.,3,6.03,200,9.18,Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune

I live in Carteret county and at the time worked in Sneads Ferry (Onslow County) and the commute to work everyday took me through camp LeJeune via the back gate. As I made the turn onto Hwy. 17 off of Hwy. 172 I noticed what I thought was a bear sitting  down under a huge pecan tree on the right. Since there was about 50 or 60 feet distance between me & ""the bear"" I decided to pull of to the side of the road & watch him for a minute. It was a warm July morning & I had the windows of my truck rolled down as usual and noticed the most ungodly smell I had ever experienced. It was kinda like rotten eggs mixed with sewage & sulfur. As I sat & watched I quickly realized that this was no bear as the creature stood up from the croutched position walked over to the pecan tree & began shaking it. I was floored by what I was watching. Understand that this tree is immense & the creature had no problem shaking the pecans from it. Pecans that are still in the green hulls by the way. I wanted a better look at it since the whole sighting was with it's back to me so I put the truck in 1st gear (ready to bug out if need be)  & blowed the horn. It suddenly stopped & just completely froze still with it's back to me. it stayed like that til I layed down on the horn about 10 seconds later & it slowly turned & looked right at me. Thats when my heart decided to do the 50 yard dash in 2.3 seconds. I couldn't see it's face that well but it stood about 8 - 10 ft. Tall & it's hair was very long & matty. It stared at me for what seemed an eternity & made a loud screaching noise & tore off into the woods. The sprint from the tree to the woods was about 30 yards or so & it took him no time to reach them. I'm talking split seconds!

Me and my brother were driving South (me behind the wheel) on Hwy 85 about 7 miles south of Crestview Florida at 1:30am when we spotted what at first we thought was a really big black bear on the side of the road (West shoulder) next to the woods. I decided to make a U-turn at the next open medium to get a better look as big bear sightings in this area are not all that common; Usually they are very small black bears. We took a U-turn at an open medium about a 1/2 mile from the initial sighting and started heading back North. We got to the point where we had first seen what we thought was a large bear and started looking across the median for it. My Brother looked to his right and spotted the thing that we had seen. It had apparently crossed the highway putting it now on the East side of the road. When we looked we saw a large upright walking (like a human) black big foot type of creature. It paused, looked like it turned its head toward us, and ran into the woods. It was too large to be a human and it definately was not a bear.

0101000020E6100000E17A14AE476D55C09A99999999593F40,26.62,"I was assigned to Ft Rucker, AL from Oct 1991 until Jan 1997 as a fire fighter. As military firefighters we would often be assigned to small airfields (stagefields) around Ft Rucker. At the time this happened I was assigned to Tabernacle stagefield. Tabernacle was on the north west end of a large impact area used for aerial gunnery by pilots in training. During a typical duty day we would have several down time periods where aircraft were not flying. These down time periods would typically take place around noon and evening lasting 2.5 to 3 hours. When I was assigned to Ft Rucker, I had met some other Soldiers that introduced me to Indian “relic” hunting. This consisted mostly of lots of walking through tilled fields, creek washouts, and recently cleared timber tracts looking for arrowheads and anything else related to the old Indian tribes that formally lived in the south east Alabama region. I had found that the down times when aircraft were not flying often granted me the chance to get out in the woods to hunt for arrowheads. Often I was able to get several miles away from the stage field during the down times and was usually by myself for several hours. My typical hiking outfit was to put on a pair of cargo shorts, an old pair of army boots, a belt with a canteen, a pouch (for any finds), a large survival knife, ball cap and a walking stick. I usually would not wear a shirt hoping to get a tan while out walking. This day in particular was in I left my stage field around 1100 AM or so. I headed East, North East for about 1.5 miles on an improved asphalt road that bordered the impact area. I then head north down a dirt road (path was more like it) that was seldom traveled. The road went up and down some gentle hills and was bordered on both sides by heavy vegetation and thick woods. I believe I had walked maybe ¾ of a mile when I was approaching a small creek crossing which was not unusual. I was maybe within 50 feet of the creek when off to my left side I heard a lot of movement approximately 150-200 feet into the woods appearing to come from the creek bank. I heard what I can only describe as a grunt and my first though was a wild pig. That thought was quickly erased though, as I immediately got instant chills…goosebumps running my entire body…and had the heavy feeling that I was not alone. I heard another grunt and peered into the woods from where the sound came from and saw a large “shadow”…easily 6 to 7 foot tall stand from the creek bed. Because of the thick woods I got no clear view of it but my first thought was that it was a large very dirty man but it definitely had the appearance of a man shape. I only saw this thing for a few seconds as it appeared to see me…and me watching it and it turned and went crashing into the woods away from me. I wasted no time turning my walk into a trot away from what I had just seen. Whatever it was it scared me and as I headed back to my airfield I tried to make sense of it. The only thing I could conceive it being was that maybe it might have been a stray horse back in the woods. I know this sounds very unlikely but I really didn’t want to believe I might have seen something I could not explain…a horse in the woods I could almost believe. I never went back into that area of the woods again, and seldom ventured into thick woods period after that. I never gave it much thought after that as I had chalked it up as being a horse, which seemed to make sense to me. I did bring my strange experience up a couple of times to some folks but they thought I was kidding them and none of them had ever heard of anything like that in Alabama before. Two things led me to revise my thinking of what I saw that day. The first being this. In 2000…I was and am still living in Kansas and serving in the Army Reserve. We had a new Soldier join my unit. He was a former Ranger Sniper team leader having been assigned to the Ranger battalion at Ft Lewis, WA. He was a good old country boy from Kansas living in a small town. He and I became very good friends and later served in Iraq together. We would often talk about events in our lives at length. During one conversation I related my story about what I saw in the woods assuming he would think I was nuts. But…he believed me. As a matter of fact he said if I saw something I found hard to believe he said that I should just go with what my gut told me. He then informed me about his experiences. He told me about his time up at Ft Lewis and as a sniper he would often be in the woods alone for days at a time in hide sites during training missions. He told me that at night in the deep woods he would often feel as if he was being watched and would hear the sounds of something large moving through the woods. Now this fellow was an experienced woodsman and was used to the sounds and smells of the woods. On occasion he was able to see something quite large in the shape of a man moving around his hide site through his night vision goggle. He said it would never come too close…just kind of checking him out. He said he never felt threatened by it and on the occasion it would make some sounds (grunts or whistles) as if it was agitated and he would talk calmly too it. He said that he wood talk in a slow, low voice telling it “I’m not here to hurt you, just calm down, I don’t mean no trouble for you”. He said that usually after he spoke towards it, it would just move away from him and would leave him alone. He said this happened numerous times as he was often in the same area. He told me he had no doubts at all that “Bigfoot” was around but he would never do anything to harm it and he felt that if left alone it would not harm anyone. So that got me to thinking, maybe that afternoon in the woods I really did see a Bigfoot. The second reason I feel that I didn’t see what I convinced myself was a horse is that after culling the BFRO website I found that I am not the only one to have seen something in Alabama. So…I am not alone and I am now convinced that what I saw was real…and not something else. I haven’t shared this story with very many people…but maybe this is the time to do it.",I have looked at some satellite images of the area and cannot pinpoint the exact spot just the area within a few hundred yards.

I was lying low in our hide providing over watch while my team member attempted to move in to within approximately 75 yards of this camp. It was at this point when three distinct knocking sounds spread no more than 1 second apart, were heard from our 6 o’clock position. The distance appeared to be within 100 yards. After a very short pause of about three, maybe five seconds, there was the sound of a large branch or small tree breaking in half. The noise was so loud that everyone in the camp grabbed their flashlights and searched the tree line towards the direction of the sound. We were almost compromised by this noise, but as quickly as the sounds were heard, the forest fell silent. Unfortunately, no one was able to further investigate those sounds due to our focus being the exercise and not the wild life. Approximately two, maybe three hours later, one of the cadre was listening to a range radio and overheard a conversation between an adjacent range and range control. The conversation spanned only a few minutes, but in summary it went like this: “Range Control, this is range #... umm, there is a Bigfoot walking across the range!” This range was only a few kilometers from our location. Early the next morning, maybe 5am, one of the members of our team had to depart the training environment so he was given a coordinate to meet for ex-filtration. He arrived early and waited until the extraction team arrived. During his time alone, he commented that he heard loud foot steps behind him. He was not sure if it was a large deer coming to investigate or what, but he said it came very close to him. So close that he was hearing this animal breathing behind him only a little ways off. He said he felt uneasy and didn’t dare turn around because his initial thought was that it might just be a buck that would become startled and attack him. A few moments later, the animal departed and shortly after he was extracted. He didn’t want to think of this animal as anything but perhaps a deer. After the exercise, we spoke with the role players about that night. They all heard the sound and thought one of us was trying to play a game with them or that one of us had fallen down the side of an embankment causing the loud noise. Once we advised them that it was not us, they just went silent and didn’t speak of it any further. The strange thing is that earlier that night I had this eerie feeling, like something was watching me from behind. My reaction at the time was to grasp my knife and prepare for whatever may come next. It never reached that point, but my senses were heightened and I found myself scanning my surroundings more often with my night vision. Due to the nature of my work, I cannot go into great detail as to the exact month or day, but I can mention that it was in the early months leading up to spring. But I cannot deny that there is something other than normal wild life in the woods surrounding Ft. Pickett, VA.

I thought it might be a bear or burglar. Me and my 21 year old son went out to investigate. I was armed with a pistol and my son had a shotgun. I saw a deer run as if it was being chased. Then I saw a huge figure coming out of the woods. This thing was at least 8 feet tall. I could not believe this! I screamed out to this thing to stop. It came towards us running. I told my son to shoot. He shot in its direction. It then ran to my left flank and continued to come toward us. We ran back towards the house.

0101000020E61000004F8D976E120B57C008AC1C5A64DB4240,64.78,"I was going through Army basic training at Fort Leonard Wood, MO.  Our platoon was on the last leg of our training and one of our final training events was guard duty at different locations throughout the post.  We were paired up and given our assignments, issued our weapons and three live rounds (Barney Fife-esque), and proceeded to load up on a deuce and a half (army 2.5 ton truck).  As we loaded up into the truck, I was the last one on since my last name starts with ""Y"", and we always did things alphabetically (significance to come later). It was mid to late afternoon and the trainee I was paired with and I were assigned to guard a bridge crossing training site that army engineers use.  It was the furthest guard site from main post, so we were to be dropped off first to guard it overnight (didn't really need any guarding since it was unoccupied at night and weekends, plus it was in the middle of nowhere - we were doing this merely for the training benefit.)  I don't really have any idea where the site was and didn't really care, all that I knew is that we must've been traveling for about 20 - 30 minutes from main post when my sighting occurred.  It must've been about 1600 - 1700 hours and we were on dirt roads.  I was sitting on the bed of the truck looking out the back, while everyone else in the platoon were able to snag bench seats on either side of the vehicle facing one another.  Everyone else was sleeping or drowsing at the time, except for me in my uncomfortable seat on the bed of the truck.  We came to a ""T"" intersection and turned left. About 30-40 feet from the intersection the other direction, I observed a bigfoot.  What is amazing to me to this day is that I am the sort of person who really doesn't believe anything unless I observe it myself, but at that initial glance, I knew immediately that it was a bigfoot - not a bear, not a big person dressed up, just a bigfoot, no doubt.  A bigfoot was on the road, looked in the direction of the vehicle, and ambled across the road into the woods.  My second thought was to scream and yell to notify someone else in the platoon, but I immediately quashed this idea since by the time I would be able to rouse anyone, the bigfoot would probably be in the woods by then.  No need for me to be rambling on about a bigfoot without any other eyewitnesses in this type of environment.  So I alone observed it. My sighting was of short duration, about 10 seconds if that, and I don't have a lot of details, but I remember that it was tall, had to be at least 6.5 feet to 7.5 feet.  I don't remember any distinctive features, except for one.  Bigfoot had brown to light brown hair/fir coloration.  I though this was extrodinary since every previous thought that I had about bigfoot comprised of black fir.  That's about it, except that during this short sighting, my mind went through all the possible explanations of what this could be besides a bigfoot and dismissed all of them.  No doubt in my mind that I saw a bigfoot. After my sighting, we were dropped of about 10 minutes later and I spent an extremely nervous night in the wilderness at this river crossing sight.  Kind of glad I had my 3 Barney Fife rounds.  I was not really surprised that they called this ""Fort Lost-In-The-Woods"" as a nickname, because it is really isolated.  I have never really made a big deal of this sighting, or do I plan to.  All I know is that bigfoot exists, and I saw it.  I am probably one of the most credible witnesses that I can imagine.

(back when they let us do such things ). The day started off normal, with my friends  Loren P., Jerry W., Tommy B., Jim O., and myself riding our motorcycles. There was a ditch about 6 feet deep, and 7 feet wide and we took turns jumping it. I was on a yellow Suzuki 185 motorcycle with a stinger exhaust system on it. I was jumping the ditch and almost crashed my motorcycle, and thought I had better quit before I got hurt. My friends all wanted to keep jumping the ditch, so I decided to ride East along a dirt trail that ran parallel to the ditch. I was in no hurry since I was not familiar with the trail, and was just enjoying the ride. I had ridden about 20 minutes or so when I saw what I thought was a white motorcycle going South. Since I was going East and it was going South I was afraid I would run into the other motorcycle, so I stopped to keep us from colliding into each other. I got glimpses of the white motorcycle as it was going though the trees, and was going to wave to the other rider as they either turned onto or crossed over the trail I was on. MUCH to my surprise the white motorcycle was not a motorcycle at all... ""IT"" was a very tall creature walking on it's hind feet like a man, but with a stride that seemed to be about 6 feet per stride. The arms were lanky and long and swung slightly as it walked, and it's hands hung down about knee level. The creature had long lanky legs, and they looked to be fairly muscular like it did a lot of walking and running. The feet were long, my guess they may have been 15 to 18 inches or so, but they seemed accurately proportioned for a creature of it's height. The creature was about 8 or 9 feet tall, and stopped right in the middle of the trail, and then turned to face me. It was about 25 yards from me, and there were no trees or brush between us to block my view of the creature. It was very tall, and lanky and was a dirty white albino color. It did not have any clothing and seemed to be covered in short dirty white hairs. I could not see any indication of the creatures sex. It's head was more of a triangular shape than round, and I'm certain it was not human. The eyes were close together, and were very focused on me...I would describe them as definately being predator's eyes. The nostril holes were small, and seemed to be about 2 inches apart, and the mouth was similar to a humans but just a bit wider. I had a full motorcross helmet on, so if the creature had an odor, I could not smell it. The only sounds I heard were the beating of my heart about to explode out of my chest, and the popping of the 185 Suzuki's stinger exhaust. The creature and I looked at each other for what seemed like an eternity, then it made a snarling expression and squinted it's eyes at me. It's mouth went from a closed frown to rising it's upper lip and showing me what I considered it's meat eating teeth...I GOT THE MESSAGE !!! Then it's eyes squinted more at me, as if it was starting to get really pissed at me for being there. About the time I thought it was fixin to attack me, it turned and started walking South again. The creatures stride still amazed me, it's single walking stride from one foot to the other was probably 4 times my stride. I'm certain that if it had tried to run up and catch me, I would not have been able to flee in time. I had a hair standing on the back of my neck suspicion that it might be about to make a fish-hook loop like an injured bear, and then suddenly pop up right beside me on the trail. I turned the 185 Suzuki around and rode like a professional to get the hell out there. I was too scared to look behind me, and was praying for Jesus to protect me as I also tried to make sure I didn't crash! I felt that if I crashed the motorcycle, it would surely catch me if it was in pursuit. It had taken me about 20 minutes or so to get to where I saw the creature, it only took about 10 minutes to get back to where my friends and I had been jumping the ditch because I was riding skentback and scared to death. When I did get back to the truck, my friend Jim O. was sitting on the bed of the truck relaxing. The rest of our friends were not at the ditch, or the truck. I yelled at Jim O. with a half squeeky pitched voice, because in my heart was still in my throat,  I said ""Jim there's something in the woods! We need to warn the rest of the guys!"" Then came my next major surprise of the day, Jim asked me ""Is it real tall and white?"" I yelled ""YES, why in the Hell didn't you tell me about it?"" Jim said ""I didn't tell anyone about it, because I didn't want anyone thinking I'm crazy, or making fun of me!"" Then Jim proceeded to tell me about the time him and his nephew Pete saw the creature while squirrel hunting at Camp Robinson. This occurred back in 1976 while I was a Senior in High School. I bow-hunt in Camp Robinson from time to time, and as God is my witness, the hairs still stand up on my neck when it's dark and gets too quiet in the woods. There have been times that I feel like something was watching me, and I immediately remember the creature I saw by the All American Drop Zone. There are times where bow and arrow or not... I waited until it got light enough for me to see before I would get out of the truck. It doesn't matter to me if you believe this story or not...I've been telling it to family, friends, co-workers, and even strangers since the day I actually saw the creature, and it saw me back in 1976.",It was just North of the All-American Drop Zone inside Camp Robinson.,Pulaski County,Arkansas,Report 57471: Memory told of a close daylight encounter with a white Bigfoot while riding a motorcycle inside Camp Joseph T.

I was hunting between two mountain ridges in the bottom of the valley approximately 100 yards from a thick creek bottom. I started the afternoon hunt at 2:30 pm finding my way to a new stand set up. I hunted all afternoon seeing alot of good deer sign in the area. After what started to be a promising day in the deer woods. I did not see a deer all day and the sun starting going down behind the mountain ridge to my west. It was getting so dark out that I could no longer see thru my peep sight. So, I decided to start packing up my backpack and start my decent down the tree. By now, it was well after dark and without my headlamp I could not see 3 foot in front of me. As I started to make my way down the tree. I heard the most disturbing sound in the woods that I have ever heard in my life. It was a very, very, loud, deep toned, gravely, blood curdling Growl/yell which seemed to be approximately 150/200 yards away from me to my southeast. It sounded as if someone was trying to yell for help. I immediately froze to the side of the tree and tried to gather my thoughts on what it could be. I originally thought that it was a person in the woods trying to play a prank on me. Mainly, because I had seen a pickup truck drive down the distant ridge several hours earlier. Then I realized that it was too loud to be a human screaming in the woods. I remained frozen to the side of the tree for several more minutes and tried to gather my thoughts of what could have made that sound. I am 43 years old and have been an avid hunter every year in some capacity since I was 6 years old and I have never heard anything like this in my life. After several minutes I finally made my way to the base of the tree, packed my stand, grabbed my bow and started to walk out on the trail that I walked in on into the direction of the ""sound"". I had about a 50 yard SE walk towards the ""sound"" then 100 yards west to an old logging road then 300 yards north back to where my truck was parked beside a small pond. So, as i left the tree walking SE and arrived at the west trail. I got a very uneasy feeling like something was watching me. So, I stopped to listen. Its was then I heard the ""sound"" again. It appeared to be moving closer to my location and approximately 50 yards away. Needless to say, I did not stick around to see what it was, for all I had was a headlight, bow in hand and a gut knife on my hip. So, I immediately start sprinting toward my truck. I have NEVER been so scared in my entire life. I started my truck and got the hell out of there. On my drive out of Camp Robinson. I called several of my closest friends and my dad and told them of the encounter. I stayed up all night on the internet to research this sound that I heard in the woods that night. I listened to mountain lions, african lions, tigers, bears, bobcats, foxes, coyotes, wild boars, etc... and I could not find anything that would come close to what I heard. The very next day. I drove back to the same area at Camp Robinson where I heard the ""sound"". Again right at dark from the comfort of my pickup truck with a pistol in my hand. I heard the sound again further down the valley approximately 1/4 to 1/2 mile away. I was a very distinct sound, very loud.... Since, these three occurrences. I have hunted at Camp Robinson on many more occasions and I have not heard this ""sound"" again. Still baffles me to this day of what I heard those two nights and I have still never heard anything like it.",East of West Boundry Road between Clifton Mountain Rd and Demolition Road on Camp Robinson Military base.,Pulaski County,Arkansas,Report 39922: Bowhunter intimidated by loud vocalizations at dark on Camp Robinson National Guard training base,34.92684,-92.30753,2010-10-30,39922,Class B,9ynqeqpxwd,72,55.83,3560,33.66,0.6,0.03,0.76,0,0,,1019.59,Clear throughout the day.,4,9.57,189,5.93,Cp Joseph T Robinson

Fort Jackson is an Army base. While I was serving in the Army on Fort Jackson something happened that might be related. We were on a training mission for escape and evasion.  I was supposed to escape through the enemy lines and make it back on my own. This was about seven or eight miles to walk through the woods, alone. As I remember the incident happened at seven pm just after dark. There was no moon. It was the darkest night I ever spent in the woods alone.  Being from West Virginia and hunting all of my life, this did not bother me too much. As I made my way down a fire lane at around two am I come to a crossing of fire lanes and stopped to rest for a minute and get my bearings. Back then there was no lights coming from Columbia or Fort Jackson to direct your way. I was about one step passed the crossing resting trying to decide on the way to go when I heard something coming. Immediately I thought another person was coming. I was happy that I would have someone to be with this dark night. I could not see my watch or my hand in front of my face only a faint white sand line path. I waited until this thing (or maybe two things) was within a few steps of me. Then I said who goes there.  This thing went to its left in a flash. It went about fifty to seventy-five feet away and just stood there. Then I heard what sounded like someone talking backwards in a sort of growl as I was standing their confused about what was going on.  In about a minute a two I heard this thing coming back toward me so I took one step to my left an kneeled down as it rounded the corner.  Then I stood up and said I got you now. That's when all hell brook loose. It took off running, crashing through the brush like a train. This is when I got really scared. The hair on my neck raised and I started to speak but was unable to. I said to myself boy you get out of here.  I must have run a half mile or so to my left and stopped to see if this thing was coming. I only stopped  for a second and started running again luckily in the right direction. I run up on an airport sergeant who had a fire built  and a truck waiting.

0101000020E6100000E63FA4DFBE8854C0789CA223B9B44040,62,"The year was 1965 while my father a military NCO Basic Training Instructor, was stationed at Ft. Gordon Georgia.  We were living on the base at the NCO old housing area.  There had recently been built a new housing area but we lived in the old Army barracks converted to housing where four families were accommodated to live in a barracks of four apartments.  There were more barracks converted to housing in the same area and woods to the left of the housing that led to some old infantry fields no longer in use of dense pine trees.  Near these woods, there were two barracks of Military Police units. One day, the girl from the apartment below informed me that her little brother would tell her that a big man would look through their window at night.  The little boy would observe the man looking into the room.  To the both of us, this seemed amazing since the window bottom ledge of the barracks where we lived was about 7 or 8 ft. from the ground.  It would be impossible for any normal size human being to look into the window from that height.  I paid no attention to it and soon forgot the story. During the summer vacations, I would enjoy venturing into the woods next to the housing area with my friends.  We would go downwind and get as close to deer as possible just to take a photo or observe the animals without disturbing them.  I remember one morning my friends were not around so I decided to go and venture the woods by myself.  As I walked down the slope into the woods and began walking on level ground just about 200 hundred yards at the edge of the woods, I noticed that a bulldozer had just scraped the land next to the Officers Housing area.  The Army was going to make a new housing for the Officers in that part of the woods.  I also noticed on the red clay of the ground some big footsteps that came from the Officers Housing into the edge of the woods where I was walking into. The last footsteps that lead into the woods from the red clay were so enormous that I began to observe them.  I noticed they were of a person walking barefoot, at least 18 inches in length and about 5 inches wide.  The person or whatever it was that had made the prints had a total of 5 toes.  I had never heard of Bigfoot and just thought it was some big person walking around barefoot enjoying the mud (red Clay). I then went into one of the many trails that led into the woods and after a few minutes, something seemed not to be right.  I did not hear birds nor did I see any squirrels.  Everything seemed to be silenced.  I could only hear the wind blowing and the trees moving in the wind but no sign of life in the area.  This began to give me what you call the goose bumps as if someone or something was watching all my moves.  I then sat on a big rock nearby and observed everthing around me and at the same time kept my ears opened.  Just a few moments went by when I started to hear some heavy bi-pedal footsteps in the grass and leaves near me at about 50 ft. of distance from where I sat.  The grass was very high and there was lots of brush that did not allow me to see more than 20 ft. into the brush area.  I guess you can say that my human nature or animal instinct just took over me, telling me to get out from there as fast as possible.  I did not waste any time, but controlled my self not to go into panic. I steadily began to walk out of the woods and as I did, I could hear the heavy bi-pedal footsteps stalking me from the left, deeper in the woods from where I was at.  If I stopped walking, it would stop walking.  If I ran a little, it would run a little.  I also became aware that whatever it was, would stop walking just a few seconds after I did.  In other words, it would stop and begin to walk as I did.  As I got closer to the edge of the woods at the red clay area, whatever was in the woods began to run very fast coming towards me.  I then thought it was time to run like hell.  I picked up a running speed that surprised me.  When I finally got back to the housing area, I was exhausted trying to get my breath back again and sat on the porch in front of my home.  A friend that lived across the street had observed me and asked what had scared me.  He said he saw me running out of the woods as if my butt was on fire.  This got me a little upset and when I finally got all my breath back, I explained the ordeal to him.  He just stood there and laughed at me.  Since he did not believe me, I made him a challenge to go into the woods with me where I had heard the footsteps.  He accepted the challenge and we both returned to the area.  While walking down the path near the Officers Housing area, I showed him the footprints in the red clay.  He observed them leading into the woods and said to me that the prints must be those of the Bigfoot monster.  I had never heard of it and told him monsters don't exist, it must be some big hillbilly or hobo person living in the area that does not want us to disturb him.  We both went into the same trail I had went into before and sat on the same rock.  Shortly after, the same weird sensation got over us.  There was a total silence and only the wind and trees moving in the breeze could be heard.  Suddenly, the heavy bi-pedal footsteps once again began to stalk us in the brush as it did when I was by myself.  I told my friend to walk a little ways and then to stop.  As we stopped walking, whatever was stalking us would also stop.  When I looked at my friend, he seemed to have changed in skin color to almost a tomato red.  I knew he was more afraid than I was at the moment.  I then told my friend to stop once again and listen to our stalker getting closer.  As we stopped, heavy footsteps began to run towards us.  We could hear the brush breaking and moving.  When I turned around to tell my friend that it was time to start running, he had already begun his run and had about a 40 ft. lead on me.  I did not waste time to look back and ran as close as I could to my friend.  When we got back to the housing and sat on my porch trying to get our breaths back, he said he had seen something big that moved in the brush.  He was not certain what it was. To date, I know it was the Bigfoot creature because of the footprints I had observed earlier in the red clay.  I did not smell anything peculiar because we were down wind from it.  We did not hear anything except maybe a heavy breathing if I could remember correctly and the brush and grass moving about as it came towards us.  I will never forget the experience and because of it, I am especially interested in Bigfoot.",The wooded area adjacent to the new NCO military Housing and next to the Officers housing just down a slope area.

From late 1977 to Dec 1979 I was assigned to Davison as a Military Policeman. The airfield is not that large and I am pretty sure it's still an active military installation even now. The airfield is pretty much surrounded by a wooded area and part of the airfield is on a small swamp. When I started working there I was chided by other MP's to be careful of the so called ""DUSAA Swamp Monster"" it was called. We had to have a walking 2 man patrol a couple times a night walk the perimeter fence inside the field area. There were countless times while on those walking patrols that I occasionally made, where sounds were heard not only from the swamp area but also the wooded area along the south perimeter fence. By sounds I mean you could hear branches breaking, not small branches mind you, but I mean a VERY LOUD audible CRACK, you'd hear dogs barking in the distance and occasionally some kind of animal - which after hearing recordings on the net of a Squatch - they sounded AWFUL familiar! Randomly I also had to pull guard at the main gate which is right there on Route 1 - the main entrance to the airfield. I've had the crap scared out of me more than I like to think about at that gate at night - you're there all by yourself in a small wooden gate shack with 1 street light right above you and that's it. Anyway, to the south in the woods I've heard bangs (what you all call knocks) and animal noises, I've seen deer running like all hell and jump the fence on to the air field in the middle of the night getting away from something and only 1 time, and it was 1 time way too many, when I saw a deer following the fence at about 2 AM one night and I heard something in the woods, I yelled out and I saw the red reflection of 2 eyes staring at me back from the blackness just inside the trees just out of range of the street light - I still see those eyes when I think about it and it's been what... 34 years!!! One night, about 10pm, or there about, I had a civilian motorist come to the gate off highway 1 and ask me to call the State Police, I asked why and he said this big BIG hairy thing... yup he said thing ... walked across the road in front of him and headed onto Ft Belvoir property and he almost hit it. He thought at first it was a man in a gorilla suit but it was way too tall to be a man. This guy was shaking like hell too.

My job at the time was as a gunner on a Bradley Fighting Vehicle. My unit was in the field conducting a training exercise which was to last a few days. The Bradley fighting vehicle is an armored tracked vehicle that normally has a crew of three; (Vehicle Commander, Gunner and Driver). One night around 2AM my vehicle was moving solo along a dirt road (we called them tank trails) in the northeast part of Fort Stewart. We were driving blacked out with no lights on. I was acting as gunner and had my head buried in the thermal sight system which is used to engage targets at night. The thermal sight distinguishes differences in heat signatures and formulates a picture in either white hot or black hot (depending on what you have selected) against a red background. The driver had the hatch closed and was using a night vision device to view the road. The vehicle commander was standing up out of the hatch looking through night vision monoculars. While moving along, if we encountered an intersection I would slew the turret either left or right (90 degrees) over the side of the vehicle to look down the road and clear it of any simulated enemy. At one particular intersection I did this maneuver,  slewed the turret over the right side of the vehicle and looked down the trail. It was clear and the vehicle made a right turn. After turning we drove approximately one hundred yards. The vegetation was extremely thick in this area due to being a swamp and about 10-12 feet high. As I was looking through the sight I observed something come out of the vegetation, approximately fifty yards in front of us, from the right side of the road and walk across the road to the left and re-enter the vegetation. The dirt road is approximately 15-20 feet wide. This creature cleared the road in three steps at a normal stride. It didn't seemed bothered by us or in a rush. I don't recall it looking in our direction. Its head and torso were straight and it just walked on. Typically while looking through the thermal sight at a person you can distinguish clothing, hair, equipment they may be wearing, etc and be able to judge their height with the surroundings they are standing in. This creature appeared through the thermal sight to be one constant color from head to foot, have no clothes on and to be fairly tall, approximately 7-9 feet. The first thought that came to my head was a bigfoot. At the time it all just seemed to make sense. From watching documentaries and reading books as a kid it all seemed to fit.  Everything happened very quickly. I was shocked when I saw it and said nothing till after it went back into the woods. I announced to the vehicle commander over the internal comm system that something just walked across the road and it wasn't a man or an animal. He got spooked and told the driver to punch it. I wanted to stop and investigate but no one else was having that. We were never able to go back and now I could only vaguely point out a general area we were in.","North east part of Fort Stewart in a training area.

It was after dark when we left and not being originally from the area, it was difficult to get my bearings. We were in the air around an hour before we landed and began our mission. All I know for sure location wise is that we were close to the Nisqually River and Mt. Rainier. The last night we were in the field, I was assigned to the LP/OP (listening post/observation post) in our defensive position's forward area. After a week of almost non-stop war games we were advised to expect a non-eventful night and to try and get some rest. My unit was set up in their defensive positions on a hill approximately 1/4 mile to my rear. I was in my foxhole alone with a wired field phone. My job was to notify HQ if our perimeters were breached. Not anticipating contact that night, I prepared myself for some needed rest. Being from West Virignia, I am used to the woods and am comfortable in that setting. Around 2am, I heard loud pronounced footfalls to my front and right. I am certain they were bi-pedal. Thinking our trainers might be trying to harass us one more time, I prepared myself for my duties. However, all I heard were those footfalls continue to my left and away. Then I smelled what I can only describe as rotten cabbage or hot garbage. Very putrid. It actually made my eyes water. About 45 minutes or so after it left my immediate area, I heard a scream I still cannot describe. It sounded painful and maybe even a bit lonely but it made the hair on my neck stand up! It was at an estimated range of a couple of miles perhaps. I nearly jumped up and ran back to my unit but I was afraid of getting into trouble and of being ridiculed so I stuck it out. Additionally, there is so much deadfall and underbrush, I could have seriously hurt myself out there at night. I never saw a thing, but feel I may have experienced a sasquatch creature. The next morning, the smell still lingered in the air. Needless to say, i did not get any sleep that night.

We had to take lower ranking enlisted men to the woods for part of the month long training, while in the NCO Academy. During one of these exercises, (a patrol or something)we had set up an observation post along this trail in the woods. I moved away from the troops so as I could better observe them and therefore, ""grade"" them on their skills.Sometime during the early morning hours, I began to smell this foul odor ( kind of like garbage or rotten eggs - whatever). A few moments later I heard this rustling of brush and braking of branches and tree limbs. All this was taking place, PROBABLY, about 25 to 30 meters in front of me. Keep in mind, it was very dark and only a little illumination from the moon. As I tried to focus on the location of this ""event"", I recognized that there was a pair of ""eyes"" looking directly at me. This creature was moving from my left to my right, staring at me. It was evident to me that ""it"" could see me clearly. I was frozen in place and panic set in immediately. I even crouched down in the bushes to try to hide myself. This ""thing"" kept moving and eventually moved out of our area. When it left, the odor disappeared, there was no more tree branches breaking, and I was petrified. I know this sounds like a load of crap - but, this happened and I have no reason to even mention this after all these years.But, do with it what you want. I just thought I'd let you know about my expereince. Thanks for your time. (Name edited out)","Somewhere in the backwoods of Ft Lewis.

0101000020E61000003CBD529621A65EC044A33B889D8D4740,49.88,"I was working as a Military Police law enforcement command soldier at Fort Lewis, Washington from November 1985 to December 1986. My barracks were on North Fort Lewis. We commonly drove from the main post provost marshal office via the Pendleton Road route into north fort. In the early fall of 1986, I was travelling this route as I had many times before in the company of my partner and friend, also an M.P., who is from Oregon. We had often spoken and joked about various legends we had heard about Sasquatch inhabiting or existing in the Pacific Northwest, and being from Ohio, I was a thorough non-believer. We were travelling northwest along Flora Rd on north Fort Lewis between the Fort Lewis Museum and 41st Division Drive, approximately ¾ mile from San Francisco Ave, at twilight, when we observed a large fur covered animal cross the road from left (w) to right (e) in approximately four (4 ) steps. It was walking upright, had a long lumbering gait, long arms, a large head, and walked mildly stooped at the shoulders, and appeared to be at least 8 feet tall. We stopped the truck and flipped on the bright headlights. Initially thinking it was a bear, I slowly rolled closer, excited about seeing my first wild bear on post. We were approximately 50 to 80 yards away, at the time. The animal stopped on the right side of the roadway at the edge of the trees, turned and looked towards us, and with one step, disappeared into the trees. I remember trembling and thinking I couldn’t believe my eyes. It was definitely NOT a bear! My partner and I stopped in the roadway, and got out of the truck. We saw where the pine limbs were still shaking where they had been parted by the animal, as it moved through. We could hear it walking ahead of us by about 30 or so yards, and then the walking noise stopped. We walked into the trees, towards where we last heard the sound. We both had our flashlights, but it was not yet quite dark, and were still in our camouflage uniforms. My friend was about 5 yards ahead of me, and we had gone about 30 yards into the woods, when a large limb cracked in a tree just ahead of us and there was a scream unlike anything I had ever heard. My friend turned towards me and began sprinting back towards the road, past me, yelling “run”, with his eyes wide open. I turned, running, to follow him and whatever the animal was, was now behind us, wailing what resembled a scream. We got back to the truck and we both noted that the other was “white as a ghost”. We rode back to the barracks in near silence. We both agreed that we had just witnessed and heard a bigfoot! The next day, after calming down considerably, we went back to the spot and found several high tree limbs bent and broken by something very large and very tall. The ground had a covering of both fresh green and brown pine needles, but no evidence of footprints. It has always been a running joke between us, even after all these years, that we encountered a sasquatch that evening. I have been a believer since that day. Many of our friends laughed at us when we told them, but several later admitted that they had seen something similar crossing the roads during late evening patrols around Ft Lewis, especially in the more remote training areas and roads, and near Solo Point at Puget Sound or near Sequalitchew Lake on North Fort Lewis.

0101000020E6100000D5E76A2BF6AB5EC084D382177D794740,45.21,"During May of 1990 I was in the U.S. Army assigned to Fort Lewis, WA. I was a member of an airborne infantry unit designated as a ""Long Range Surveillance Detachment.""  In brief the unit's mission was to deploy 4-6 man teams onto a battlefield and conduct surveillance operations of enemy supply lines and troop movement corridoors. During that month the unit deployed my platoon into a drop zone known as Merril Drop Zone around 0300 a.m.The platoon's teams were to conduct surveillance operations of predesignated road intersections for a 48 hour period then link up together at the area known as Cat Lake in the South Rainer training area. From there we were to walk back to the barracks. All went as planned until the link up date. Being a native Pacific Northwesterner and having a heart stopping run in as an eight year old with what I still believe to have been a bigfoot, I will not discount ""stories"" of bigfoot type info until they have been researched. There were at the time of this incident several stories about the ""Cat Lake Monster"" which had been circulated by the old timers since the early 80's. There were about 13 of us in the platoon at the time and we were planning to just bag out for the night and not play the typical Army game of having a ""watch"" up all night. The night was very clear, which was unusual for this time of year, but the woods surrounding Cat Lake and the adjacent Fiander Lake can be almost pitch black. The only light was from a near clearing in the woods at the base of a small hill. The light came from the full moon. As the rest of the platoon quieted down I believed I was the only one awake. I initially heard what I believed was an elk or deer ""huffing."" It was a heavy sound of air being blown through nostrils. As I listened I pin pointed the sound to be coming from the hill over-looking our postion, on the far side of the opening about 100 yards away. The sound came both nearer and louder over the next few minutes, but was still a ways up the hill. As I listened the sound changed to a ""barking"" type, became more intense and was followed by the cracking of limbs and trees. I tried to see into the tree line but it was too dark. I then looked up at the tops of the trees on the hill that were backlit by the full moon. At that point I could see a tree shaking back and forth.The vocalizations became angry sounding and it occurred to me there may be a bear up there, although the sounds were very strange. The tree shaking contnued but whatever was shaking them came closer and closer, choosing different trees. I could by this time hear something sliding down the hill through the vegitation. Several of the smaller trees had fallen over.The area we were in is a natural rain forest and very swampy.There are several rotting trees in the area that can be pushed over with a few good shoves. By this time I was completely on my feet. I still had not seen the creature and was relying on the backlit and shaking trees to keep my bearings on the creature. I realized the shaking stopped at the edge of the clearing in front of me, and I could feel myself being stared at. The feeling was intense and distinctly threatning. One of my fellow teamates, the only one senior in rank to me at the time, was by this time standing behind me though I did not know it until he spoke to me. He asked what was happening and I pointed to the area on the far side of the clearing where the tree shaking had stopped. As we both watched a large up-right form stepped into the edge of the moonlit clearing. It stood there for about 30-45 seconds and again made the ""huffing"" noise, much louder this time. The creature's form was very heavy looking, with broad shoulders, but very man-like. Shortly thereafter the creature turned slightly to our left and began running through the edge of the clearing. The creature ran in an up-right postion and swung it's arms in large arcs. The steps were loping and heavy. We could feel the feet hitting the soft soil.  It cleared the 300 yards of clearing in seconds and was gone. I turned and grabbed my gear, stuffing it in my pack, thinking to wake everyone up and get everyone moving the opposite direction the creature went. As I looked across the circle the platoon had spread themselves into, I realized everyone was already awake and jamming gear as fast as they could go. The entire platoon was awake, packed and moving the other way in bare minutes. The following day I and the other member of my team that had awakend returned to the area in daylight. We found several trees that had been knocked over, and fresh dirt turned up on the hill side as though something heavy had walked/slid down the hillside. No actual prints though were located.","Fort Lewis, in an area known as the South Rainier Training Area adjacent to two lakes known as Cat Lake and Fiander Lake.",Thurston County,Washington,Report 1587: Loud vocalizations sounds heard,46.94913,-122.6869,1990-05-03,1587,Class A,c22g04y4s0,69.89,57.55,2418,49.43,0.74,0.73,0.31,0,0,,1026.4,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.,5,7.59,352,3.19,Ft Lewis

I was assigned to Company E 4th Battalion 2nd Brigade. That is were my barrick was. Between the barricks was an open field 100 yds or more wide. On the other side of the field the outline of the forest trees began and after them more trees and more trees. Anyway it was winter and it had snow. The area was covered in snow. It was a cold clear night. There was a full moon which illuminated the night sky. I can't recall what month it was. I was assigned guard duty of our barricks area. My shift was the early mouring hours (After midnight). I was to walk for two hours patrolling our company area.You could hear the crunching of the snow under my boots as I walk.

Lewis Washington to conduct some day and night patrols. I remember the exact day because we listened to the Mike Tyson fight on the radio earlier in the day while in the field where he bit off Holyfields ear. While at Ft. Lewis during a night patrol we got off of the path we were supposed to be on and ended up in some deep brush that was thick and hard to get through. I was the point man on the patrol and carrying a SAW which is a fully automatic machine gun and it was loaded with blanks. While busting through the brush I encountered something that was very big and shaped like you would think bigfoot would be shaped but only saw it in the dark with no lights except for the moon. This large thing and myself were within probably ten feet of each other and it scared us so badly that I opened fire on it with the SAW and the blank rounds to run it off. It ran through the brush on two legs taking huge steps each time and busted through the brush like it was nothing and disappeared over the hill in seconds. Ever since this day I have always known that it was a bigfoot that I saw that day. This was in 1997 before computers and google so I had heard rumors afterwards that Washington was a hot spot for bigfoots. I never knew until now when I ran into this website that there is more sightings of bigfoot in that area than anywhere else in the US. I googled to see what county Ft. Lewis was in and was very surprised when reading through the stories from that county that there was several other sightings on the base such as mine.

This street turns into a two lane country road that makes one of the borders of Joint base Lewis-McChord. It is a long dark two lane country road that bisects a huge prairie with lots of old growth woodlands bordering it. I drove home the back way again tonight hoping to pinpoint the exact location for you, but there are no mile markers nearby where I seen what I saw. The best I can do, is it is Approximately 4-5 miles out from town, the road is largely flat and straight, but there are a few rises as you drive. The place I was at was about 3-400 ft from the second place where there is a rise in the road. I know this because I could see the creature with a hill in the background and some trees, and when we drove up through there tonight there was no place else that fit those two things. First off, it was very dark, and oddly devoid of cars, as there is usually someone flashing their lights at me as my car has a headlight out and I have been driving with my brights on until payday to get it fixed. I think if I had not had my brights on, I would never have seen this creature. At any rate, suddenly I seen the Patterson Film in real life, about 400 ft down the road ahead of me. The creature I saw fit the same color scheme of Harry and the Hendersons, but in behavior it was nearly identical to the Patterson film. It strided across the road in 3-4 strides, and in as many was way off to the right again when it stopped mid-stride and looked back at me exactly like the patterson film, but this thing looked huge, even from the distance I saw it. When you see something that does not fit into the ordinary part of what you perceive as your reality, your brain tries to pidgeon-hole the data into one file after another, click click click click and suddenly you come up with ""Does not compute"" At first I thought was a smudge on my windshield, but it was moving right along. Just like the patterson film. So I went to work, and several people live near me and I decided to tell somebody. One guy had a girlfriend who seen him within a mile of my house within a month ago, and then a week ago his father came home at midnight telling him he had seen one in the same area in the headlight of his Harley where a small creek runs under the road and the creature appeared to be crossing the road where the small bridge was. It's weird how this effects you. I could really see how someone could keep this to themselves for their entire lives. However, when I shared this story, I got ""Oh yeah, this happened and that happened,"" To ""My Cousin, My Brother, My Dad, and even a couple of personal stories from people who grew up here. I was always willing to give it an open mind, but the lack of physical evidence sort of left me wondering, if I had to be honest.

When we first saw the individuals they were on the far side of the open meadow. I remember that there was a bright moon out because we could see features such as trees, and objects well enough to run without tripping. In fact we could see through some of the pines. That is where we saw the individuals. At first we thought they were the capture team looking for us. They were back in the tree line when we first saw them. There was a road not far behind them and we could see what we thought were soldiers moving very slowly (not forward or back at first). When they breached the tree line, Mickles decided that we had enough space between us and them to escape if they were part of the capture team. He thought it might be some like ourselves who escaped early and got out of the boundary area. Mickles got up and started walking towards them and I followed. They were just silhouettes, but as we got closer Mickles waved at them, then they started moving towards us faster; not really running, just faster. Mickles called to them and they came faster without answering. I have never heard of bears walking upright, and for sure not that fast but I didn't know that much about bears. I did know that something wasn't right and I was really scared. I really didn't think they were bears or people;  I don't know why.  I just know I have never been that terrified and so was Mickles. We ran as fast as we could without looking back, but felt they were gaining on us. I told Mickles to follow me and dove under and crawled up under a large low pine tree. We just lay there. We could feel their presence but didn't dare move. That is when we smelled this weird odor. I am sorry I can't describe it to you. It was strong is all I can say.

We ran as fast as we could and caught the bus. We never looked back, except in memory. I have hunted all over the U.S. from Colorado, to Illinois, to Texas. What we saw the silhouettes of and smelled was not humans, or any bear.","Ft.

Once when I was nine, I was going to the orchard a mile or two away and decided to go through the woods to get there. My mother told me to keep the barbed wire fence on my right and it'll take me to the orchard. Well I didn't see a fence and went left. I walked for roughly about an hour and had a strange sensation of being watched for a while. I was watching the ground and kicking a small pebble down the trail, when I heard a snap of small branch. I looked up and the small underbrush of ferns and tall grass was moving so I went to go look at the spot thinking I spooked a deer or something. I couldn't see anything, but noticed that the moving underbrush was right next to a yellow caution tape piece in the tree. I thought nothing of it and continued up the trail. I came to a dirt hill and climbed to the top to see where I was when I fell and rolled to the bottom, twisting my ankle. I was angry that I couldn't get up yet so sat and poutted for a while, then slowly climbed back up the hill after testing my ankle. I was walking or rather crawling up over the hill to go back the way I came when I heard the brush again and felt very... not exactly scared but closer to frozen. I didn't want to see what was in the bushes and kept flashing back a few days prior to my dog getting split open by a bear. I counted to twenty before I opened my eyes and looked and there was nothing. I figured I was just being silly and to make it home as soon as possible because it was starting to get dark. I walked back slowly to the caution tape to see what I could and didn't want to see and there in the dirt was a foot print. Considering I was nine and pretty small for my age I was scared and confused. I was learning to the tracks of animals in the area and had never seen one like this. I thought it looked funny because the pinky tow was stuck out at a funny place and it was almost twice my size. I do not remember the exact time or date but I know it was early afternoon when I left home and almost dark when I got back home. But then again I also lived in and around nothing but fir trees and very liitle traffic. I did try to tell my mom when I got home what I found and that I thought it followed me to protect me, beacause I kept hearing the bushes move like there was something walking with me out of eyesight. At first it scared me and I tried so hard to ignore it but after awhile the feeling kind of toned down and I started to feel safer and not so worried about meeting the dog killing bear. It followed me right up till the time I crossed the fence to my property. When I finally started to tell my mom after many screaming panic attacks beacuse I had been gone so long and scared her so bad, she told me she didn't want to hear about my wild imagination when I was obviously so scared. But to this day I still had flash backs and feel good at that fact that I believe many years later that I was being watched and protected in a way by a sasquatch. And I am happy that they are out there.","At this time there were many trails and animals and since then has been mowed over and paved with houses, I do not remember exactly where it would be but I can take a video camera and see what it is like now.

0101000020E61000005C8FC2F528AC5EC001DE02098A7B4740,47.2,"I am prompted to submit this story after reading several months ago on this website about the incident that took place in August, 1967 in the same area.  It has taken me a couple of months to decide to submit this report, but am now convinced that it may be helpful to you: I was an Infantry Lieutenant with the US Army in April, 1979 participating in a escape and evasion (E&E) course.  Our class was dropped off at the southern end of Weir Prairie in the South Rainier Training area late that afternoon.  The purpose was for us to break up into small teams and E&E north to the Nisqually Bridge.  We were given 24 hours to accomplish this and had to evade search teams on jeeps that were sent out to pursue and capture us. A relatively large group (about 10 men) chose to follow myself and my Platoon sergeant (name unknown) and we proceeded north along dirt roads as far as the intersection of roads 1 km northeast of Flander Lake.  There, we started to encounter jeeps patrolling the roads. We decided to leave the road 1 km north of this intersection and walk due west cross country to another dirt road that ran north-south.  About an hour and a half into our walk we began to worry that maybe we were lost. There was much dead fall and dense brush that slowed us down. My platoon sergeant walked ahead to scout out the area while we rested.  When he did not return a half hour later I went forward to find him. I'd walked about 100 meters when I heard noises  to my right front that sounded like heavy foot steps.  Thinking that our pursuers would not be off the road after us, I called out my sergeant's name.  A large, dark and hulking figure loomed up at the other end of a clearing about 50 feet in front of me and ran to my front for about 20 feet.  I only saw it for a moment before it disappeared into the woods.  I turned to go back to my patrol when my platoon sergeant appeared.  He asked me if that was me running around out there crashing in the bushes.  I told him ""no"", that maybe he saw and heard what I saw. We compared notes briefly and decided it was not a deer, a bear or another human.  From his angle, he only saw a dark form running away from him into the woods. We decided to say nothing to the others and proceeded on since whatever it was, it probably wanted nothing to do with us. We reached the other north-south road about 45 minutes later and continued to our destination without incident.  Later, at the end of course, I checked with the other E&E teams to compare routes and where they were at that time and found that the nearest team was well over two kms away. Over a year later, just before my platoon sergeant was ready to transfer to Germany, we talked about the incident.  Both of us were hunters and outdoorsmen.  Whatever it was, we were both convinced that it was a not a deer, a bear or another animal and the way it moved through the woods, not possibly another person.  Whoever it was definitely wanted to get away from us. I have trained in the same area off and on for quite a few years after and never saw or heard of anything similar until I read the August, 1967 report.  I have heard since that there are bear in the area, but I doubt that is what we saw that nite.","The incident took place at Fort Lewis, Washington in the Rainier Training.

At the time Beale Air Force Base was closed so we went on the base in the mountains. We camped out in the old barracks area that first night. My friend had his two retiever dogs with him. It was dark and we were in our bed rolls. We heard a very loud yelling - almost a scream - coming from the woods about a hundred yards away. The dogs went crazy and headed towards the wooded area. My friend and I grabbed our rifles and followed them. I have never heard a sound like that before. Just as we got a short distance away from the woods, we seen something that the dogs were running around. It was on two feet. It grabbed one dog, threw it some distance and swung on the other dog. I had it in the flashlight beam but couldn't see it too well. It turned towards us and my friend said that it had a face like that of an ape.

We went to our camping spot that we have gone to for over 20 years and set up camp. This was on Friday night. The next day was uneventful and we were both tired so we went to sleep about 8 PM. Sometime later in the evening, I awoke to very loud screaming and some sort of yelling that I have never heard before in all my years of being in the wilderness. The screaming lasted about 20 to 30 seconds, stopped for about 20 seconds, then started again. This happened 3 times. I finally got my brother-in-law to wake up and he heard about 4 or 5 seconds of the third time. We were both very tired and he fell back asleep in seconds. It was really quiet. You could not hear anything. I could not go back to sleep after that. I laid in my sleeping bag inside the tent for about 30 to 40 minutes with dead silence in the forest. When I was just starting to doze off again, I heard footsteps entering our camp. I heard the footsteps, which were not of a 4 legged animal, walk past my side of the tent. It walked around the entire tent and I saw a shadow on the end of the tent about 5 feet high. With the moon being up in the sky, whatever cast the shadow had to have been taller than 5 feet. It circled the tent and walked by my side again. It stopped at the other end of the tent and scratched the material like it was trying to figure out what the material was. It walked away from the tent after that and went across the gravel road. I could hear the gravel under its feet. After it crossed the road, it went into the woods. After a minute or so, I heard the sound of 2 sticks hitting together about 15 to 20 times. Nothing else happened for the rest of the night. The next morning, we got up and I told my brother-in-law what else had happened during the night. We looked for tracks around the tent, but the ground was covered with a thick layer of leaves and pine needles. We looked on the road , but the road bed is red clay based and very hard.

We were walking for about 4 hours down a game trail when we heard strange grunting sounds, almost like a buck (deer) during mating season. Being an avid hunter though, I knew it wasn't a deer. We walked quietly towards the sound, hoping to find perhaps a bear or something. We were both armed with military type rifles, so we were not fearful of our safety. Moving another 100 meters or so, the sound became louder and more frequent. The sound was now accompanied by the crashing of rocks. As we rounded a bend in the trail, just SE of us I spotted what appeared to be a huge black bear standing upright. It didn't see us, and it was only about 80 meters away, but the woods still masked it. We moved even closer, and now it appeard as if there were more than one. As we got close enough to make the creature, it was nothing either of us as seen before. It was about 6'5 or more, it had a huge upper body and it appeared to be lacking a neck. This was NOT a bear. My buddy and I looked towards each other, remaining silent and using hand signals. We moved away, we were both scared to death! Don't ask me why, we were armed to the teeth but we just didn't know what we had just seen. We moved back to the safety of the bend we just rounded and began talking about the possibilities. We both concluded it was a bigfoot we just ran into. Now confident we were able to defend ourselves (we talked about old stories of them being hostile.. I knew nothing about them), we moved back to investigate. Actually, we planned on confirming this was not human or a common animal, then we were going to terminate it. Yes, we though we would be famous.. As we moved back towards the last known location, we were unable to find the creatures. We found evidence of their being there, two rocks that weighed at least 200lbs were sitting one on to of the other (fresh marks on them as if one was dropped on the other from several feet) and broken branches. We didn't find any foot prints, but there was a lingering odor...like animal dung but more powerful. We got the heck out of Dodge and told no one, until now. We looked in the base library and discovered that there were laws on the books protecting these creatures in many states. I am glad we didn't run into it (them) again.
