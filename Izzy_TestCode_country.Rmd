## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("janitor")
library("ggplot2")
```


```{r}
bigfoot <- read.csv("bfro_reports_geocoded.csv") %>% clean_names()
```


```{r}
alchohol <- read_csv("alcohol_consumption.csv") %>% clean_names()
```


```{r}
glimpse(alchohol)
```


```{r}
glimpse(bigfoot)
```

```{r}
cleaned_bigfoot <- bigfoot %>% 
  filter(latitude != "NA" & longitude != "NA") %>% 
  select(county, state, number) %>% 
  mutate(county=str_remove(county, " County"))
```


```{r}
sightings_county <- cleaned_bigfoot %>% 
  count(county, name = "sightings") %>% 
  filter(sightings >= 4) %>% 
  arrange(-sightings)
sightings_county
```


```{r}
joined_al_bf <- full_join(cleaned_bigfoot, alchohol, by=c("state", "county"))

```



```{r}
bf_al_co <- joined_al_bf %>% 
  count(county, state, percent_excessive_drinking) %>% 
  filter(n > 5) %>% 
  arrange(-n)

```


```{r}

  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarize(mean_al = mean(percent_excessive_drinking)) %>% 
  arrange(-mean_al)

al_rm
```

```{r}

```



```{r}

```{r}

       x="Percent Average Excessive Drinking",
       y="Number of Sightings")+

```

```{r}

       x="Percent Excessive Drinking",
       y="Number of Sightings")+

```


```{r}
bigfoot

```


```{r}

  mutate(county=str_remove(county, " County"))

```

```{r}
merged_data <- full_join(bigfoot, alchohol, by=c("state", "county"))
```

```{r}
merged_data <- merged_data %>% 
  select(-observed, -title, -fips, -location_details) %>% 
  filter(latitude != "NA"& longitude != "NA")

merged_data
```


```{r}
top_counties <- merged_data %>%
  group_by(county, state) %>%
  summarize(total_sightings = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_sightings)) %>%
  head(10)

top_counties
```


```{r}
top_counties %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(county, total_sightings), y = total_sightings, fill=state)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(title = "Top 10 Counties with Most Bigfoot Sightings",
       x = "County",
       y = "Number of Sightings")
```

```{r}
merged_data %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(avg_temp = mean(temperature_mid, na.rm =T))
 

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
