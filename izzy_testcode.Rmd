## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("janitor")
```


```{r}
bigfoot <- read.csv("bfro_reports_geocoded.csv") %>% clean_names()
```


```{r}
alchohol <- read_csv("alcohol_consumption.csv") %>% clean_names()
```

```{r}
glimpse(bigfoot)
```

```{r}
glimpse(alchohol)
```


```{r}
alcohol_cali <- alchohol %>% 
  filter(state == "California")

bigfoot_cali <- bigfoot %>%
  filter(state=="California")
```


```{r}
alcohol_cali <- 
```







Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
